# REACTOR
This is a PLC program to control a reactor that is used to produce the mixture of two fluids, the fluids are first mixed properly by a mixer, heated to a certain temperature as defined by the operator, and cooled. The cooling phase marks the end of the process and the mixed product is passed out of the reactor. Siemens TIA Portal is the software used to write this program.
